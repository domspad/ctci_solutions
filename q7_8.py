# Chapter 7: Object-oriented Design
# Problem 2: 

Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other 
When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides, or both the top and bottom, 
it is said to be captured and its color is flipped On your turn, 
you must capture at least one of your opponentâ€™s pieces The game ends when either user has no more valid moves, 
and the win is assigned to the person with the most pieces Implement the object oriented design for Othello

Solution 1 : 

designed for 2 players 
only one main class that hides a lot of inner functions
when started, runs continously until game is over
